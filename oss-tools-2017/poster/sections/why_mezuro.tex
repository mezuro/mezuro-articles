\begin{block}{Why Mezuro?}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item 100\% FOSS solution.

        \item Continuously generate reviews about a project, via customized
            scheduling.

        \item It allows a level of metrics configuration and composition that
            is not available in other tools analyzed.

        \item Related tools such as SonarQube and Code Climate:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Are not complete FOSS.
                \item Do not allow the same metric configuration that is
                    available in Mezuro - Mezuro even allows the control of
                    the formula used in the evaluation.
                \item Do not allow processing scheduling.
            \end{itemize}
