\begin{block}{Project Features}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mezuro features related to a project, responsible for defining
            Mezuro as a source code metrics platform:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Obtain and evaluate source code from compressed file or
                    tools such as Git, Subversion, and Bazaar;
                \item Code processing scheduling;
                \item Use of multiple metrics configurations for multiple
                    projects;
                \item Visualization of results per file via plot graphics;
                \item Extensible architecture to include new metric collectors;
                \item Public results that are accessible by the community.
            \end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Metric Configurations Features}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Metric configurations features are responsible for allowing
            definitions and spread of metrics configurations, being
            one of Mezuro stand out factors among the others platforms.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Metrics creation;
                \item Metrics configuration cloning, giving users a quick start
                    to rate their projects, and the option to use already well
                    established metrics configuration;
                \item Statistics about most popular configurations in the
                    community;
                \item Creation of ``reading groups'' to be used in textual
                    interpretation of metrics results;
                \item Configuration of qualitative ranges associated with
                    value of metrics;
                \item Combination of native metrics to create composed and more
                    complex analysis.
            \end{itemize}
