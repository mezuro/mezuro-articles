\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Static source code metrics are measures extracted from the code without
compiling or running it. For example, these metrics provide information about
complexity, comprehension, testability, maintainability, and evolution of code,
supporting software engineers to observe and determine source code
quality\cite{mills1988}.

Nowadays, several tools propose to extract source code metrics, such as
pylint\footnote{\url{pylint.org}} (Python),
metric\_fu\footnote{\url{github.com/metricfu/metric_fu}} (Ruby), and Analizo
(C/C++ and Java)\cite{terceiro2010analizo}, each one with different levels of
usability, definitions, and set of metrics.

In general, source code metric tools also do not present a friendly way to
interpret its results and, even more, do not follow a standardization between
them.

In this context, we create a platform that brings and presents these results to
the end user, specially, by analyzing source code metric history during its
life cycle.

This work presents the Mezuro platform which (i) provides a single interface
grouping available tools; (ii) allows selection and composition of metrics in a
flexible manner; (iii) stores the metrics evolution history; (iv) presents
results in a friendly way; (v) allows users to customize the given
interpretation accordingly to their own context.
