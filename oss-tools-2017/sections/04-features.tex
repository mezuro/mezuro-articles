\label{sec:features}

Mezuro features can be divided in two groups:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Project features
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Obtain (download and upload) and evaluate source code from
            several SCM tools repositories (currently Git, Subversion, and
            Bazaar), or from compressed file;
        \item Code process schedule with results preservation, not forcing
            users to manually evaluation from time to time. Currently,
            allowing 1 day, 2 days, weekly, and biweekly scheduling;
        \item Use of multiple metrics configurations for multiple projects;
        \item Visualization of measurement results per file via plot graphics
            with values over-time;
        \item Extensible architecture to include new metric collectors;
        \item Public results that are accessible by the community.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Configuration features
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Metrics creation, even allowing the definition of formula used to
            evaluate the source code;
        \item Metrics configuration cloning, giving users a quick start to rate
            their projects; and the option to use well established metrics
            configuration;
        \item Statistics about most popular configurations in the community,
            increasing the easiness to decide what configuration to use;
        \item Creation of qualitative ranges associated with values of metrics,
            allowing better control of metrics already defined;
        \item Combination of native metrics to create composed and more complex
            analysis.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Mezuro has also a strong learning aspect, in which participants are able to
observe other projects, or clone their configurations and definitions, to learn
with them.  This open mutual interaction is interesting to project managers,
software auditors and even an entire developer team. The Mezuro main goal is to
help software developers and maintainers to understand and feel comfortable to
use source code metrics during the development cycles of their projects.
