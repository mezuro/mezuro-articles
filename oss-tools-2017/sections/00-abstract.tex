% Contexto
The ease of development and maintenance of a software is directly related with
its quality.
% Problema
However, software source code analysis has issues such as the definition of
which metrics to use and how to interpret the results. Furthermore, this
practice is still not common in industry development workflow. Those who decide
to employ source code analysis lack free software alternatives that integrate
multiple languages and tools.
% Soluções propostas
In this work we present Mezuro: a FOSS web-based platform to collaboratively
analyze source code. The project provides features to compare projects and
share knowledge about metrics, teaching how to configure and interpret them.
The platform was planned to integrate multiple metric collectors for several
programming languages, and, currently, it allows analysis of source code
written in C, C++, Java, Ruby, PHP, and Python.
% Frase de impacto
With this project we aim to spread knowledge and encourage the use of code
metrics by the free software developer community.

\textbf{Keywords:} Static Analysis, Source Code Metrics, Software Quality,
Free and Open Source Software.
