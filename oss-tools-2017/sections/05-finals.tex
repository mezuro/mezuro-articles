\section{Final remarks}

Mezuro architecture evolution is an answer to the lack of tracking and
standardization of source code analysis. It is a solution 100\% FOSS, highly
customizable, with support to many programming languages, history processing
and a friendly way to interpret source code metrics. Furthermore, it was built
on top of an extensible architecture planned to easily embody new features by
the FOSS Community. Mezuro source code is licensed under AGPLv3 and available at
\url{github.com/mezuro}, as well as, it is in production at \url{mezuro.org}.
